# Score Publishing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive score publishing system where interviewees do not see their scores immediately after each question. Instead, scores are only revealed after the interviewer explicitly publishes the results.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Updates (`src/store/useInterviewStore.js`)

#### Added Fields:
- **`scoresPublished`**: Boolean flag added to each candidate object
  - Default value: `false`
  - Tracks whether interviewer has published scores for this candidate

#### New Function:
```javascript
publishScores: (candidateId) => {
  // Marks scores as published for a specific candidate
  // Makes scores visible on interviewee's completion screen
}
```

#### Updated Functions:
- **`addCandidate`**: Now initializes with `scoresPublished: false`
- **`resetCandidateAssessment`**: Resets `scoresPublished` to `false` when interview is reset

---

### 2. Interviewee View Updates (`src/pages/IntervieweeView.jsx`)

#### Changes to Question Feedback:
**Before:**
- Showed detailed score breakdown after each question
- Displayed: Score X/5, percentage, technical accuracy, completeness, communication metrics

**After:**
- Only shows qualitative feedback without scores
- Still displays:
  - ‚úÖ General feedback
  - üí™ Strengths
  - üìà Areas to improve
  - ‚úì Key points covered
  - ‚úó Key points missed
- Removed all score displays

#### Updated Messages:
- After last question: *"The interviewer will review your performance and publish the results."*
- Emphasis on waiting for interviewer to publish scores

---

### 3. Quiz Interface Updates (`src/components/QuizInterface.jsx`)

#### Completion Screen - Before:
```jsx
<div className="quiz-stat">
  <span className="quiz-stat-value">{finalScore}/{maxScore}</span>
  <span className="quiz-stat-label">Final Score ({percentage}%)</span>
</div>
```

#### Completion Screen - After:
**If `scoresPublished === false`:**
```jsx
<p>Your responses are being reviewed by the interviewer.</p>
<p>‚è≥ Scores will be available once the interviewer publishes the results.</p>
```

**If `scoresPublished === true`:**
```jsx
<p>Your responses have been evaluated and scored.</p>
<div className="quiz-stat">
  <span className="quiz-stat-value">{finalScore}/{maxScore}</span>
  <span className="quiz-stat-label">Final Score ({percentage}%)</span>
</div>
```

---

### 4. Result Publish Modal Updates (`src/components/ResultPublishModal.jsx`)

#### New Import:
```javascript
import { useInterviewStore } from '../store/useInterviewStore';
```

#### Updated `handlePublish` Function:
```javascript
// Publish scores to make them visible to interviewees
candidatesToPublish.forEach(candidate => {
  publishScores(candidate.id);
});

// Then send emails...
```

#### Added Info Alert:
- Clear explanation of what happens when results are published:
  - üìä Scores become visible to interviewees
  - üìß Email notifications sent
  - ‚úÖ Shortlist emails sent
  - ‚ùå Optional rejection emails

üìä Scores now visible to {n} candidates
üìß {n} rejection emails sent (if enabled)
```
